      If all or many jobs showing as impacted, there is likely an issue with Diego.
      1. Investigate the Route Emitter and Diego BBS logs for errors.
      2. Verify that app routes are functional by making a request to an app, pushing an app and pinging it, or if applicable, checking that your smoke tests have passed.
      If one or a few jobs showing as impacted, there is likely a connectivity issue and the impacted job should be investigated further.
